        <h1>Working effectively on a daily basis</h1>
        <p>Learning outcome</p>
        <p>
            You can substantiate the importance of planning and organising your study (and work) 
            and have indicated the extent to which planning is a development theme for you.
        </p>
        <p>Question 1: Using at least two examples, describe how the tips from this module have helped you to achieve your goals on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>
            In the first period, we had a lesson with our teacher where he told us about a famous technique called the 
            "Pomodoro Technique". It really caught my attention and I wanted to try it out. I started applying this technique
            during self-studying when I have many assignments that I have to do, I divide them into smaller subtasks. 
            In addition, I write a checklist of things I must do and later I put a checkmark on a piece of paper when I
            am done with those assignments. I set the timer for 25 minutes and I try only to concentrate on doing the tasks.
            What is more, I get rid of things that could distract me (e.g. mobile phone). I am doing a maximum of work during 
            this 25 minutes and during the 5-minute break I relax and don't think about work at all. Then, I often repeat this 
            for 4 times and I feel that I am working more efficiently and more effectively because I don't get distracted 
            from working and don't waste time on useless things. This way, I think I am even finishing quite big tasks quicker 
            because I stay more concentrated and motivated to finish them and after that have some rest. What is more, after 
            reading this module I found some tips which I am going to use during studying and even when I will work. I am going 
            to make a to-do list for the day and prioritise the activities and at the end of the day, I will check my progress how
            many things I have done, and how much I spent on them.  What is more, at the beginning of this studying year I set longer-term 
            goals which I want to achieve during this year at university. I tried to be quite specific and wrote down in detail exactly what 
            I have to do in order to achieve them. At the end of the year, I will see what I achieved or maybe what not and think about why 
            this happened and what should I do next time in order not to repeat those mistakes.
