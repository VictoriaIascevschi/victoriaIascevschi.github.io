            You have researched the extent to which you actively 
            participate in class, and have substantiated this with 
            examples. You have formulated a number of points for improvement and 
            substantiated in practical terms what you are going to do to gain even 
            more from class.

                <p>Social disincentives</p>
                <p>Question 1:</p>
                <li>How positive is the social climate in your class or group of friends to perform?</li>
                <li>To what extent do you let your social environment stimulate or inhibit you?</li>
                <li>Support your answers with examples.</li>
                <li>Do you see reasons for yourself to change this?</li><br>
                <p>
                    To my mind, the social climate in my class, and especially in my project group is quite positive.
                    Most of my classmates and my team members are motivated and hard-working students who inspire me 
                    to also work hard and put effort into my studying in order to be on the same level of knowledge 
                    with them. Many of them have quite a lot of experience in IT which they are ready to share with 
                    everyone and they are willing to help and explain any topics. I believe the working environment 
                    plays an important part while studying at university and people around you have a big influence 
                    on you and your progress. It is even a bit easier to work with people who want to work and are 
                    organised. This way, you can learn more effectively and work together is easier as everyone puts 
                    effort and in general these people care about studying and their future. Working with people who 
                    set goals and know what they want and how they will do that are successful people who eventually 
                    reach a lot in their lives. In addition, being part of a group where others are ambitious, motivates
                    me to set higher goals. Team members celebrate achievements and help each other during challenges, 
                    providing support and motivation to move on despite the challenges. We can collaborate and motivate 
                    each other and share ideas without judgment. Also, students learn more when they collaborate and work 
                    in groups. While I may not control others' behavior, I can control how much weight I give their opinions 
                    and actively seek environments that foster growth. I hope I will continue enjoying working with my classmates 
                    and together we will achieve all our goals.

                <p>Question 2: What are your most important reasons not to go to class? Argue why you think this is good reason or not.</p>
                <p>
                    The reasons for not attending class can vary greatly depending on personal circumstances, priorities, and values. 
                    Physical illness or mental health challenges might make attending class difficult and not useful. It's difficult 
                    to concentrate and work when you are sick because you usually feel tired and your brain is not able to work properly. 
                    Also, as a reason could be that if the class feels irrelevant to my goals or the teaching style does not engage me.
                    This means that the time spent could be better invested in self-study or other productive activities. For instance, 
                    if I can learn the material more efficiently through online resources(e.g. watching video tutorials, or reading a book), 
                    skipping a poorly taught lecture might make sense. It might be that the teacher uses inappropriate teaching techniques
                    which makes the lesson ineffective and not understandable for students. However, there are some cases where skipping 
                    class is a reasonable choice, consistent attendance is usually a better approach.
                </p><br>
                <p>Question 3:Why is it useful to attend classes? There are many good reasons for that. You'll find several below.</p><br>
                <p>Assign a mark between one and ten to every reason to indicate how important that reason is to you.</p>

            Question 4: What are your most important reasons to go to class? Explain to what extent these 
            reasons already encourage you to go to class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally, I think there are lots of reasons why attending class is beneficial and important. 
            Attending class allows me to directly engage with the instructor during his lecture, ask questions,
            and receive clarification on specific topics. Asking questions during the teacher's explanation is 
            quite effective and it makes the complex topics more clear and understandable. The opportunity to 
            interact in real-time and gain insights beyond textbooks strongly motivates me to attend, especially 
            for subjects I find challenging. In addition, getting advice from experienced teachers is really useful
            because you can know exactly what is waiting for you in your future job and you can be more prepared and
            aware of the challenges which you might face. A class provides a structured schedule and pace for covering
            material, which helps in staying consistent with studies. This helps me stay on track and classes often push 
            me to study in order not to fall apart and manage the time correctly to have enough time to cover all topics. 
            Group discussions, brainstorming, and sharing ideas in class offer perspectives and broaden your knowledge. 
            Attending class provides insights into what is expected during exams, including hints, examples, or practical 
            demonstrations. This is a major motivator because instructors often emphasize key points or clarify exam-related
            doubts. In addition, regular attendance of classes makes me more organised and responsible. I'm trying to be 
            consistent and I know that only after hard work and lots of effort, I will see the results. The reasons above 
            strongly encourage me to attend class, particularly when it comes to gaining clarity on difficult topics and staying 
            prepared for assessments or exams. However, their influence can vary depending on the relevance of the session and the 
            instructor's teaching style.
        </p>
        <p>
            Question 5: Substantiate the extent to which you make effective notes during class and use the theory and feedback
            to describe at least two things you will be doing starting tomorrow to make your notes more effective.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was mostly used to taking notes on paper with a pen because we weren't allowed to use laptops while 
            studying at school. However, now I quite often type on my laptop instead of writing with a pen. Now I 
            want to come back to writing my notes by pen during lectures. I will use the advice form this module and
            during lectures, I will describe important concepts as briefly as possible in my own words. In addition, 
            after the lesson, I will arrange my notes improving them with additional information and it will be easier
            to study those notes again before the test. What is more, I will process new information more effectively 
            as it will stick to my memory and I will remember that information for a longer period. Also, I will be more 
            focused during the lessons because I will think about the new information and process it properly. As a result, 
            it will be easier to understand it and structure it in my head.
