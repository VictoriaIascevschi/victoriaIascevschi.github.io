        <h2>Feedback from Kyan Jeuring</h2>
        <p>
            During the Sunny Socks project I noticed that you were keen to learn new thing and always 
            asked someone questions when you didn't understand something. I remember that we were working
            online with each other for 3 hours and you would ask me to explain the code I was writing.
            I got the feeling that you wanted to deliver the best quality you could provide to the project 
            and even if you didn't know how to begin you would go to someone and ask for advice. 
            I think that your way of learning new things by asking people is a great habit, however sometimes 
            try to search the answer on the internet. You might get better results on the internet than your classmates can provide you.
            Keep asking questions and strive to learn new thing, that's the way to a good career.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            You surely stood out as a team member thanks to your involvement in the project, your curiosity and eagerness to learn. 
            I appreciated the fact that you never hesitated to ask questions, which proves your attention to detail and your desire to deliver quality work. 
            Your sociable self also left an impact on the team, as it helped maintain a balanced and calm atmosphere within the group. 
            Working with you gave me the feeling that you are a reliable and trustworthy teammate who strives to develop and improve even when things become complicated. 
            As a result, I knew I could easily collaborate with you on any task knowing that we would easily be able to achieve a great outcome. 
            I look forward to you keeping up these qualities and pursuing them in the future as well.

        <p>
            You are a very careful and thoughtful person. I am sure that if I give you a task, you will do it very well. 
            Your focus and care always lead to great work. I never get worry about your tasks because I know you would 
            always come up with a great result . As a result, everyone in the group try their best when they see the quality 
            of your work so they would also do their assignments and tasks with high quality. I really like to you continue
            this behaviour and you get better and better.

        <h2>Feedback from Frederic Cahn Von Seelen</h2>
        <p>
            Victoria, you’ve been an integral part of the team, not just as our team secretary but also through your contributions to 
            the project itself. On the administrative side, you’ve ensured that meeting notes are always detailed and accurate, follow 
            ups are clear, and there’s little room for confusion about our tasks or decisions. Beyond that, your work on Linux has 
            added valuable technical support to the project. Your ability to handle both administrative and technical responsibilities 
            makes me feel really confident in our team’s capacity to tackle challenges. It’s great to have someone who not only ensures 
            we’re organized and informed but also actively contributes to the project’s progress. It’s both reassuring and motivating 
            to see how you balance these responsibilities so effectively. Because of your thorough administrative work, the team has 
            been able to stay organized and focused, which has saved us time and prevented miscommunication. At the same time, your 
            technical contributions have effectively moved the project forward, bringing us closer to our goals. Honestly, I think 
            you’ve been doing an outstanding job. Your ability to balance these responsibilities is impressive and hugely valuable 
            to the team. Keep it up!
        </p><br>

            Victoria, you’ve shown yourself to be a great assistant and organizer throughout the project. You always keep the team informed 
            about important updates and events, ensuring everyone stays on the same page. Your organizational skills and ability to 
            manage communication within the group are valuable, and they help create a sense of clarity and direction for the team.
            Your efforts made it much easier for the team to stay coordinated and focus on the tasks at hand. It’s clear that you’re 
            an important part of keeping things running smoothly.One area for growth would be building your hard skills further, which 
            will allow you to contribute even more directly to project tasks.
        </p><br>
        <h2>Feedback from Joey Harms</h2>
        <p>
            You are a really valuable asset to the team, as you are a very determined person and really wants to work, which makes you 
            a very hard worker. This makes me feel comfortable because I know that whenever things happen you will help to try to fix it and you will
            finish assignments on time whenever you need to. Because of your determination and willingness to help, you boost our group’s 
            motivation and overall boost our project. I hope you will remain a really good team player and you will stay a determined person.
        </p><br>
        <h2>Feedback from Sean Mushava</h2>
        <p>
            You are a kind, energetic, organized individual who is always looking to improve yourself and others in any way that you can.
            I trust you will complete any task you set your mind to. I sometimes don’t feel the need to offer assistance, but I know if
            you have a problem you will always speak up. Don’t change yourself, continue to be yourself.
