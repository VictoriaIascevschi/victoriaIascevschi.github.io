 <li>How do the assessments of the different team members differ?</li>
 <li>To what extent do the assessments of the different team members correspond to your self-assessment?</li>
 <h2>Your answer</h2>
<p>
    The most important thing I received was honest and constructive feedback. It helped me grow as a team member 
    and get more information on how to develop my skills and understand what requires more attention. My teammates
    supported me, respected my input, and gave me the confidence to take initiative and guide the group. After two 
    periods of working in two different groups with different people, I decided to be the project leader the first 
    time, as before, I wasn't ready to take such a big responsibility because of the lack of experience. During period 
    3, we also had a session where we gave feedback to each other. Overall, the assessments were quite consistent. Most 
    team members highlighted my strong communication, effort, and reliability. They also appreciated my willingness to
    help and explain things when needed. It was encouraging to see that my contributions were noticed in similar ways 
    across the group. Some differences came in terms of specific suggestions for improvement. One team member, for example, 
    asked me to set clear goals at the beginning of our team meetings when I was the project leader. That feedback stood 
    out and gave me a practical way to improve. After that, I started setting clear goals and deadlines for the tasks that 
    had to be done for our project so everyone could clearly understand what each of us had to do. I would say that the 
    assessments of the different team members matched closely with how I view myself. Like my teammates, I see myself as 
    hardworking, supportive, and organized. The suggestions they gave — such as improving how I set goals or lead meetings 
    — aligned with areas I had already identified for development. It reassured me that I’m self-aware and on the right path.

<h2>General conclusion</h2>
<p>Your answer</p>
<p>
    Giving and receiving feedback is a fundamental part of personal and professional growth. In a collaborative environment, feedback is what allows individuals and teams to reflect, adjust, and improve. When feedback is offered constructively and received openly, it leads to better understanding, higher performance, and stronger working relationships.
    One of the most powerful aspects of feedback is that it opens up communication. It encourages honesty, shows that all team members care about improvement, and helps build trust. When team members know that their voices are heard and valued, they become more engaged and motivated to contribute.
    Just as important as giving feedback is the ability to receive and truly listen to it. It takes maturity to not take feedback personally, but instead to view it as an opportunity to grow. Even small suggestions can lead to meaningful improvements, especially when they come from people who’ve worked closely with us and see our strengths and weaknesses from another perspective.
    In my own experience, feedback has played a key role in how I’ve developed both my personal and social skills. It has helped me become more aware of how I lead, how I communicate, and how I support others.
    Overall, a feedback culture is essential for any team that wants to grow and succeed together. By taking time to give proper feedback and being willing to act on the feedback we receive, we not only improve ourselves but also contribute to a more effective group dynamic.
