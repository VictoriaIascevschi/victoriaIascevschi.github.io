        <h1>The Importance of Planning and Organising</h1>
        <p>Learning outcome</p>
        <p>
            You can substantiate the importance of planning and organising your study (and work) 
            and have indicated the extent to which planning is a development theme for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Question 1: Why do you think planning is important during your study programme? Include the terms 
            effective and efficient in your answer.
         </p>
         <p>  
            To my mind, planning is crucial during my study program because it helps me manage my time 
            correctly to fulfill all tasks properly before the deadline. While organizing my time I can 
            put priorities this means:  I focus on the most important tasks first to ensure my efforts 
            lead to a successful result in a more effective way. This way, it saves my time and energy
            wisely to achieve success more easily.  As a result, I am improving my efficiency in studying. 
            In addition, a well-organized study plan means that I will understand and absorb the 
            course material and have a sense of control over my studies. Also, it reduces stress as
            all assignments are done on time as it sometimes impacts negatively on academic success. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Question 2: To what extent should or do you want to develop your planning skills further? 
            Substantiate your answer with at least one example.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would like to not only improve my effectiveness but also my efficiency. I want 
            to manage to do complex tasks quickly just in a few specific steps without wasting 
            time.  That is why I want to enhance my abilities in planning. I guess this is very 
            useful especially while working on long-term projects because planning helps to ensure 
            that the work is made on time and it was done before the deadline. What is more, 
            the ability to manage time is crucial for project leaders and team members as it 
            is easier to fulfill all responsibilities.
