        <h1>Explore Your Study Programme</h1>
        <p>Learning outcome</p>
        <p>
            You have a general sense of how your study programme is structured. You
            have summarised that which is most important for you.
        </p>
        <h2>Question 1</h2>
        <p>What do you think of your current knowledge level with regard to your study programme?</p>
        <p>What areas should you explore further?</p>
        <p>
            When I had just entered the university I did not have any knowledge in IT, so I chose 
            this course to become an IT professional and find out how everything works. Personally, 
            I believe that technologies are our future even now everything is connected with them and 
            I want also to know more about them. From the first studying day, I started to receive 
            lots of new and useful information not only from teachers but also from my classmates.
            My level of knowledge has considerably increased and I am very willing to receive even
            more information. I have never worked in a group where we need to gather all our knowledge
            and follow the common goal. Now I understand how gripping it is as together we have more
            knowledge and more ideas which we can put together to achieve our goals quicker and easier. I
            enjoy doing research, watching tutorials, or just reading books so that I can find the answers
            to all my questions.  I really enjoy the way teachers teach students and when I do not
            understand something I can ask questions or the teacher will find a different approach 
            to how to explain the topic to me. I want to gain knowledge in many fields which are 
            connected with IT, I do my best to improve my skills in writing the code and doing 
            the design for my project. I am sure that when I will be better at these areas 
            I will want to go further and learn something completely new.  It is difficult 
            for now to say exactly what I want to learn but if I find out about something
            interesting I will definitely learn how it works. I should not stop on something
            particular because there are lots of different areas connected with IT. This means, 
            that there will be always something new to learn.

                <h3>Study programme</h3>
                <li>What will you be learning over the course of the study programme? </li>
                <li>How is the study programme structured?</li>
                <li>What are the possibilities for work after graduation?</li>
                <li>At what moments do you have the freedom to choose what?</li>

                    During the study program, I will work on assignments from real companies, collaborate in 
                    small groups with different people and every time we will have to work on different projects, 
                    draw on the skills and experience of lecturers and professionals in information technology. 
                    The university uses the method of working (Design-Based Education) so that we can learn how to 
                    draw on feedback to adapt our ideas and become more flexible, while also developing our teamwork 
                    and leadership skills. We get hands-on experience of what it’s like to research and understand a 
                    company’s IT setup and develop solutions based on the needs of the company and its users. 
                    The program focuses on areas such as software, cyber security, web technology, company networks, 
                    databases and programming languages. After graduation, I have a wealth of career opportunities 
                    and I will be able to work in and manage a team and have the knowledge and skills to understand 
                    and take on a variety of roles. I can work as an IT consultant, software engineer, embedded 
                    systems engineer, etc. The first half of my third year is dedicated to my internship. I will 
                    spend five months on an internship at a company which I will choose, it can be in the Netherlands
                    or abroad. I will arrange the internship by myself.  Also, during the fourth year, I will have 
                    to do minors and again I can choose the country where I want to do them and I have to focus on 
                    a specific subject and expand my knowledge by taking an additional subject. This allows me to 
                    truly take charge of my education by ‘customising’ my course.

                        <p>
                            Over the whole course of an IT programme, I will develop a range of profession-specific competencies
                            essential for a career in information technology. During the first year, I will program in HTML/CSS, PHP, 
                            Java, C, and SQL. In addition, I will learn the principles of setting up and maintaining a network and 
                            installing a web server with a database. During the third period, I will learn how to work with hardware
                            in the BattleBot project. Finally, for the time of the fourth period, we will have to start our own project 
                            and paired with a module in computational thinking, learn what decisions are needed to realise success. For 
                            an IT profession, key knowledge areas include programming languages, collaboration, software development,problem-solving skills, 
                            etc. As for important skills, I think it is essential to be able to adapt to new technologies quickly, communicate well
                            not only with clients but also with all team members, know how to program, and be good at problem-solving. To my mind, 
                            an important attitude for the IT profession includes being flexible to adapt to new technologies willing to learn all
                            the time and improve skills, and determined as there will definitely be some obstacles on the way to success. Also, 
                            it is essential to be creative to innovate, be open and friendly to work in a team, listen to the feedback from others, 
                            and understand and meet the user's needs effectively. In addition, it is significant to be responsible to finish all 
                            projects on time.

                                        It is quite easy to find my way around the building as there are signs with the classroom numbers or I 
                                        can use the YOS to see the campus map.  As for the blackboard, it is quite easy to use but sometimes it 
                                        is a bit inconvenient as it can take some time to find the necessary study material.

                                    To my mind, I am not in very close relationships with my teachers yet but I really enjoy their 
                                    way of studying, and the atmosphere during lessons is very pleasant. I really enjoy the fact that 
                                    I have the opportunity to ask teachers questions and they are always ready to answer them or when I
                                    do not completely understand the topic or I have some doubts I ask teachers to explain it in a different
                                    way which will be more simple and available for me.  All the knowledge that I receive during lectures 
                                    we have to use in practice so that we can clearly understand how it works and where we can use it. In 
                                    case of problems or some personal questions, I can turn to Miguel who is our coach this year and I already
                                    had the individual meeting with him at the beginning of the first period. Also, we are going to have them
