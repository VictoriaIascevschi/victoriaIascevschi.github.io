        <p>10b. Open question</p>
        <p>Describe one value that is very applicable to you and substantiate your choice with a personal example.</p>
        <h2>Your answer</h2>
        <p>One value that I find very important and useful is discipline. Discipline is the ability to stay committed to a goal, be consistent, and push through difficulties even when motivation fades. It is what transforms ambitions into achievements and helps go through life's challenges with resilience and determination. When I entered the university I started to develop my discipline. Now we have weekly assignments from some of our subjects and projects. I set my own deadlines for these assignments and try to do them earlier in order to have more free time at the weekends. This way, I can have more free time and I don't need to worry that I am running out of time as I always have some extra time if I need to do any corrections. Also, when I first started learning to code at the beginning of the study year, I was excited and highly motivated. However, as the concepts became more complex, I often felt overwhelmed and frustrated. There were times when I wanted to give up because I didn't understand a particular topic, I was struggling when I was writing code and there were lots of mistakes. What kept me going was discipline. I made a structured study plan, committing to learning at least an hour every day(apart from weekly tutorials at university), regardless of my mood or external distractions. Even on days when I felt tired or discouraged, I reminded myself that progress is made through persistence, not just bursts of motivation. Over time, I saw gradual improvement. Concepts that once seemed impossible became easier, and I eventually reached a level where I could solve complex problems with confidence. This experience taught me that discipline is more than just following a routine, it’s about building mental strength and determination. It enabled me to develop problem-solving skills, patience, and confidence in my abilities.</p>
        <p>12a. Table question</p>
        <p>
            Divide your activities into<br>
            1. What do you want/need to do in the coming period? Make a list of activities in the left column of the matrix below.<br>
            2. Put a tick next to an activity that is urgent. Does it really need to be done quickly?<br>
            3. Then tick the importance per activity. To what extent is it essential?<br>
            4. This is how you draw up your time management matrix for the coming period. Urgent and important activities will (automatically) appear in the top left quadrant; urgent but not important activities in the bottom left quadrant, etc.

        <p>12c. Open question</p>
        <p>How did that work for you? Explain your answer with a few examples of activities of which you had doubts with regard to which quadrant they belong in.</p>
        <h2>Your answer</h2>
        <p>When applying the Time Management Matrix, I found that some activities were difficult to categorize because they could fit into multiple quadrants depending on the situation. For example, about watching tutorials on YouTube and doing some research on topics I'm currently studying at university in terms of long-term learning, but if a tutorial directly relates to an upcoming exam or project, it could be considered "Urgent, Important." Also, while teamwork is crucial, whether this task is "urgent" depends on deadlines. If there's no immediate due date, it might fit under "Non-urgent, Important" instead. Or about working on the documentation some of the documentation parts have a deadline in the middle of the studying period and some of it has a deadline at the end of that period. Based on that I can decide whether it's urgent or not.</p>
        <p>12d. Table question</p>
        <p>What do you want to change in terms of your priorities? Motivate why and describe how.</p>
        <h2>Your answer</h2>
        <p>I would like to improve the way my team works. I am the project leader so I decided that it would be a nice idea to use a structured approach like weekly progress meetings. Helping teammates is important, but sometimes requests can be delegated or scheduled for later if they are non-urgent so that we can focus on more important and urgent tasks. In addition, I always encourage my teammates to sit together so that we can help each other if it is needed on the spot without postponing the troubles. As a result, everyone feels free to ask for help and share their thoughts without slowing down the whole team's work progress. To my mind, handling team-related urgencies more strategically leads to better time management, stronger team efficiency, and reduced stress. By implementing a structured working plan, encouraging problem-solving way, and setting clear availability, I can contribute to teamwork without sacrificing my own priorities.</p>
        <p>13. Open question</p>
        <p>Quadrant two: what activities would have a tremendous positive effect on your life if you spent more time on them? Include the most important ones here.</p>
        <h2>Your answer</h2>
        <p>I would like to focus more on taking part in team projects because I want to develop collaboration and leadership skills which are crucial for future success. As a result, I will have better teamwork, stronger problem-solving abilities, and more impactful contributions to projects. Also, we will learn together and grow with all teammates who will contribute and put in effort. This way, we will engage consistency in discussions, provide meaningful input, and take initiative in projects rather than waiting until deadlines approach. Also, I think putting enough effort into writing well-organized documentation ensures clarity and better project execution. Again while working on documentation we improve teamwork and writing skills. Improved project outcomes, better communication within the team, and useful reference materials for future work. Work on documentation regularly during the whole period instead of rushing it just before submission. Here also helps time management which helps to submit everything on time and reduces stress that we are running out of time.</p>
        <div class="questions">
        <ul>
            <p>15. Open question</p>
            <h3>Say no: </h3>
                <li>To what would you have liked to say no in the past period?</li> 
                <li>Why didn't you do it?</li>
                <li>To which next request are you going to say no?</li>
                <li>Which of the three options from the exercise do you choose?</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
            <h2>Your answer</h2>
            <p>I would have liked to say no to frequently checking and responding to non-urgent emails which sometimes distracted me from more important work and I had to waste time on useless things. I wanted to be helpful and avoid seeming uncooperative. Also, now I say no to overcommitting to group work because sometimes there were situations where team members didn't finish their work and I ended up taking on extra work because others weren’t as engaged. I felt responsible for ensuring the project was completed well. However, now at the beginning of the project, we clearly define responsibilities from the start and hold everyone accountable. I will redistribute work fairly instead of taking on extra tasks myself. Saying no is not about being unhelpful—it’s about protecting time for what truly matters. By setting boundaries, I can focus on important tasks without unnecessary stress. I don't mind helping others but firstly I need to finish my work which is urgent and important and then I can help if it is actually needed.</p>
