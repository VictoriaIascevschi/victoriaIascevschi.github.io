        <h1>Effective studying</h1>
        <p>Learning outcome</p>
        <p>
            You can evaluate your own study behaviour using proven effective strategies and habits and 
            determine the actions that are most relevant for you to improve.
        </p>
        <div class="questions">
            <ul> 
                <p>Your learning style</p>
                <li>Question 1: What were the results of your learning style test?</li>
                <li>Do you recognise yourself in the results?</li>
                <li>Explain why the outcome does or does not apply to you.</li>
                <li>Which learning style or combination of learning styles does your study programme (or a particular part of your study) appeal to?</li>
                <li>What personal learning behaviour do you think you can adjust to study more effectively?</li> 
            </ul>
        </div>
            <p>
                The results of the test showed that mostly my learning style is application-oriented and I completely 
                agree with it. I always put learning material into practice and am especially motivated to learn something 
                that allows me to do something in professional practice or my daily life. Moreover, I prefer to use my 
                knowledge in practice and I believe this way I am learning more effectively and I can understand the topic
                better. This means, I usually look for the opportunity to experience the material, for example, in my work 
                placement to see how it works and I think about how I could also apply these new skills in the future work. 
                Personally, I enjoy a combination of application-oriented and meaning-oriented learning styles. In my opinion, 
                these are the most effective and useful styles for learning because they include using the knowledge in practice 
                and you gain knowledge by critically judging, drawing logical conclusions, and formulating your own ideas which 
                intrinsically motivates you to learn: you think it is important for you to make the study material your own. As a 
                result, you look for the message of a text by looking at connections within the text, the underlying structure, and 
                effects in the outside world and finally, you have different knowledge which you are able to combine together and get 
                use of it. To my mind, in order to make my studying even more effective I should also pay more attention to 
                reproduction-oriented way of learning. This means, paying more attention to the details, not just the broad outlines. 
                In addition, I should do plenty of practice exercises and learn by soaking up information quickly and then quizzing myself.
                As a result, I can know exactly which topics I have to practice more and pay more attention to them. Also, thinking about 
                any questions I might get about this during the test and prepare for them in advance.

                            This means starting to learn the material from the beginning of the new period 
                            at university until its end. Every week gather and learn new information, divide 
                            the content into smaller topics or sections, and plan short, focused sessions over 
                            several days. Use the knowledge in practice and discuss it with other classmates. After
                            that, include a review of prior topics during each session. This way, I can understand
                            what I learned properly and what I have to revise again. In addition, mixing topics to 
                            make connections and avoid monotony helps to connect different topics and use learned 
                            knowledge in the future for different issues.

                            Firstly, identify the foundational skills or knowledge needed for the subject.
                            Secondly, create simple examples to practice these basics. As a result, using the 
                            knowledge in practice helps to remember and understand it better. What is more,  
                            it is important after completing examples, to review what you learned and how it 
                            connects to the broader topic. Also, modify and extend the examples to explore different 
                            angles or test your limits. Every time, step to the next level which will be a bit more 
                            difficult than the previous one.

                        <td>
                            Attending classes faithfully is a crucial step in academic success. Classes
                            provide opportunities to ask questions and engage in discussions directly with 
                            teachers and students. Also, it is important to discuss what you learned with the 
                            classmates while working on the project. This way, we can share our ideas and help 
                            each other if it is needed which can clear up misunderstandings on the spot, reducing 
                            confusion when studying later. Regular attendance keeps you on track with others and you
                            don’t miss key information or announcements. What is more, it is important to take notes 
                            by pen which helps to process new information properly and remember it better. In the future,
                            these notes make the preparations for the exam easier. In addition, at the end of the lecture 
                            ask questions to clarify points and make sure that new information was understood correctly.

            <p>After trying out the three tips, look back and consider which one worked best for you.</p>
            <p>
                Question 5: Write out a short pitch below for a fellow student. A pitch is a short 
                explanation with which you try to convince someone of something.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tell your fellow student: why do you think this strategy works so well? How did you go about it? 
                What do you advise your fellow student to do?
            </p>
            <p>
                To my mind, I enjoy all those tips and especially spreading the learning material over several study 
                moments and gathering practical examples for the material. Personally, I believe that dividing time on 
                each task is very important in order to make sure that I learned every topic and I properly understand them. 
                Also, creating schedules shows how much time is spent on studying particular topics and keeping a balance 
                between different topics. What is more, practicing also plays a key part in learning effectively. It helps 
                to focus better on your skills, enables you to understand better, and gives you time to reflect upon your 
                shortcomings to improve them with time.
                Personally, I would recommend these two tips to share with other students. I strongly advise using them 
                because they make studying effective and structured. Organising time and tasks makes studying clear as you 
                know what you have to study and how much time you have for it. Creating your own schedules with study planning 
                gives an overview of topics you are going to study and dividing time for them makes studying efficient. When you 
                study gradually you give your time to process the new information and remember it. You can see the progress and 
                avoid monotony helps to connect different topics and use learned knowledge in the future for different issues. In 
                addition, after practicing it you improve your skills and you can try to solve more complicated tasks and go to the
                next level. Also, by modifying and extending the examples to explore different angles or test your limits. Finally,
                if you follow these strategies and put in effort, you will be able to see the growth and process quite soon.
