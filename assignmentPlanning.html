      <p>5. Open question</p>
      <p>Use an example to substantiate how setting goals helps you to achieve important matters.</p>
      <h2>Your answer</h2>
      <p>Personally, I believe when you have clear, concrete goals, each step you take becomes a source of motivation. In addition, when you clearly know why you are working and what you will achieve it fuels your enthusiasm and determination, driving you to overcome obstacles and stay committed to your plan. Also, goal setting boosts focus, persistence, and motivation. They help us stay focused for longer, recognizing and emphasizing our personal need for self-improvement. What is more, it is important not to allow your goals to remain only in your thoughts, but rather write them down, for anything that is written down, and in front of our eyes on a daily basis will have a better chance of accomplishing. Reading and re-reading your goals will allow you to pursue and intensively realize them, and also will create an external feeling of urgency: those 2 traits will not be valid if your goals remain only in the form of just a thought. Also, it is good to write goals that can be reached within different time frames. You should have both short-term and long-term goals. If all your goals can be accomplished within the next 3 months it only indicates that you are not challenging yourself enough, and would rather play it safe, not wanting to step outside of your comfort zone. Dream big, and set goals before yourself that will require lots of work, time, perseverance, determination, and diligence. The journey will not be easy, but I can assure you that it will make your life one that is interesting, happy, and worth living. Moreover, many studies show that individuals with clear goals often achieve the goals they set and report improved overall satisfaction because they better understand their goals and what they have to do to achieve them.</p>
