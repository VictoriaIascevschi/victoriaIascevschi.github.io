        <h1>Procrastination Behaviour</h1>
        <p>Learning outcome</p>
        <p>
            You have made a coherent summary of the type of procrastination behaviour you are 
            showing, given concrete examples of this and given reasons for what you are going to do about it.
        </p>
        <p>Question 1: Describe a situation in which you postponed something. Why did you do so?</p>
        <p>
            I remember when we were working on the project with my team in the first 
            period. We were creating a website and writing the code for it. On the 
            last day after we submitted the work just before the deadline, we 
            found out that we forgot to go through our work as we planned to because we
            postponed doing that and eventually we didn't have time to do that as it was too
            late and there were some errors in the work we had already handed in. We all were
            quite upset and stressed. Luckily, we explained the situation to the teacher that
            we didn't notice those errors and it would be unfair that we did hard work and 
            finally our mark would be lower than we actually deserved. They allowed us to 
            correct those mistakes and send the work again. I guess it all happened because 
            we worked hard and a lot on the project and we didn't leave time for going through 
            the whole code before submitting it. Also, we were quite tired of working on this
            project and we wanted to submit it and be relieved. However, we had to think in 
            advance about it and be more attentive to what we were doing and how.

                    <td>
                        <strong>Perfectionist Procrastination Behavior:</strong> Writing and rewriting a professional email multiple times before sending it, fearing it may come across as unclear or unprofessional. Doing things professionally and putting only high standards and tasks which they must achieve.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        People who want everything to be perfect and demand the highest standards possible. Trying to be perfect in everything, doing tasks on time and doing them perfectly to feel proud and relaxed that they are <strong>actually</strong> done on a high level.

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <strong>Crisis-Maker Procrastination Behavior:</strong> Postponing tasks until the last moment to create a high-pressure environment. For example, it can be starting exam preparation the night before because the urgency motivates intense focus. Or completing assignments in the last few hours before the set deadline.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Thriving on adrenaline because you believe you perform better under pressure and stress makes you work more <strong>properly</strong> and the tasks are completed on a quite high level. It boosts their creativity and productivity which helps them to do the tasks.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <strong>Defier Procrastination Behavior:</strong> Resisting tasks that feel imposed or unnecessary. It can be ignoring a colleague’s request until lots of reminders because it’s not aligned with defier's interests. They want to feel free and only do what they want and decide how they want to do that and when.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Defiers like to be independent and want to decide for themselves how to do things. They hate authority or when something is prescribed or ordered to them. They just ignore requests from others if they don’t feel like doing them. They are more interested in their <strong>wishes</strong> and they only decide what they will do and even when it causes some conflicts with other colleagues.
