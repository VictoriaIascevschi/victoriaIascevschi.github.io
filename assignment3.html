            Question 1:
            What type of behaviour do you display most in a collaborative setting?
            Are you oriented towards actions, people or thoughts? Please explain your answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Write down your chosen option(s) as well.</i>
        </p>

        <img src="photos/Screenshot 2025-01-09 at 20.22.08.png" alt="thought-oriented">
        <p>
            To my mind, I consider myself mostly to be thought-oriented because I usually have a 
            strong desire to understand how things work and I am often eager to learn new things. 
            I am into tackling challenging problems and getting into details on how to solve them 
            correctly. I usually focus on specific problems and think deeply about them, doing 
            necessary research and analyzing concepts.  After doing the research I can present 
            people my ideas with evidence so that everything is simple and clear for understanding.
            To sum up, I am always willing to improve my skills and gain more knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>Question 2: Which team role did you choose? To what extent do you recognize yourself in the explanation of this team role? Please explain your answer.</p>
        <p>
            To be honest, it is difficult for me to choose one of these roles as I found myself in three different team roles. 
            I think one of my team roles which suits me is Plant (creative thinker) because I enjoy generating new unique 
            ideas and solving hard problems. Also, I am quite philosophically minded and a free-spirited person. In addition,
            I found myself in the role of a Team worker as I am cooperative and I always want to create a pleasant atmosphere
            in a team so that everyone can have good relationships and enjoy the process of working together. To my mind,
            I also can be an Implementer(practical leader) because I am reliable and efficient. I know how to correctly 
            turn ideas into actions and I ensure that they are executed on time.

                    <td>
                        I recognize myself in the team role of a team worker because I am caring, I try to avoid conflicts 
                        or even if they occur I try to solve them as soon as possible and I do my best to foster harmony so 
                        that all team members can get on well with each other and working in a team will be pleasant for 
                        everyone. Also, I can recognize myself in the team role of an implementer as I like clear agreements 
                        about the responsibilities of each group member. In addition,  I am organised, disciplined, and 
                        structured and I like when the team has clear instructions for all the tasks which have to be done
                        and the deadlines are not missed. However, I am not sure about the team role of a coordinator because
                        it is a very big responsibility. In my opinion, the coordinator has to be professional in many aspects
                        and help all team members to do their tasks. In case, of problems, the coordinator has to provide 
                        support to the team members and help them to find the solutions. I believe that I don't have enough 
                        experience yet to hold such a position that is why now while I am working in a team I am learning 
                        from my team leader how he copes with all such things. Create a friendly and cooperative team is
                        quite a complicated task and the coordinator has to do his best to achieve such result. Being a 
                        coordinator means that he makes sure that everyone's ideas are heard and team members can trust 
                        each other. Moreover, he has to make sure that everyone is oriented towards the same goal and that 
                        everyone puts effort into achieving success together.

        <p>Question 5: What is the most important feedback you received?</p>
        <p>Describe how the feedback obtained relates to the characteristics of the team roles that suit you.</p>
        <p>  
            In my opinion, Alex who is my team leader correctly described my team roles and clearly explained his point of view.
            In his feedback, he mentioned the characteristics which describe me and suit my team roles. I agree with his opinion 
            and I will work on myself to improve my skills and knowledge to be able to do the work better. Alex mentioned that I 
            am good at generating ideas and creating something new and unique. However, I really have to be more realistic, and 
            ideas I have I should probably change a bit so that it will be possible to bring them into real tasks which will be 
            achievable. In addition, I am not good at solving some challenging problems yet and I am going to learn how to focus 
            on such tasks and do my best to be more strategic and discerning. This means I will do more research to understand the 
            problem and get into details of it and I will try to find possible solutions. Honestly, I do not have much experience 
            in IT field but I am very willing to get new information not only from teachers but also from my team members who can 
            share their useful and practical skills with me.
        </p>
        <p>Question 6: What new information about your strengths and weaknesses in a collaboration have you gained from the feedback?</p>
        <p>
            I really enjoyed the feedback from my team leader because it was clear and supported with explanations. I am very 
            thankful for this feedback as now I am going to improve my skills and knowledge and I know what I have to focus on. 
            I totally agree with all the points that Alex mentioned. I am going to do my best to be more sober and strategic 
            and I will concentrate on realistic solutions to the problems. Also, I will try to understand the pros and cons of 
            my ideas and how they will influence our project in the future. What is more, I am going to do some research and get 
            more into details of my ideas so that later I can introduce them to my team and we will clearly understand all
            the actions and tasks that have to be done to bring the ideas into reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Question 7: According to the theory, which two roles do you collaborate best with? Is this reflected in the actual
            collaboration with your project group? Support your answer with an example.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my opinion, now while working with my team, I am combining the roles of a team worker and a plant. I am trying
            to generate new ideas and be innovative. So that later I could present these ideas to my team and we could improve 
            our project. Also, I am interested in other team members' opinions and I want to hear their feedback. What is more, 
            I am always ready to help my team members and share my knowledge and skills as we are all working on a common goal 
            and only by doing it together (combining all the knowledge which each of us has) we will manage to achieve success. 
            In addition, I am doing my best to create a friendly atmosphere in our team so that everyone has good relationships,
            and in case of obstacles on our way, team members will be ready to support and help each other.
        </p>
        <p>Question 8: According to the theory, which two roles do you collaborate less well with? Is this reflected in the actual collaboration with your project group? Support your answer with an example.</p>
        <p>
            Personally, I believe that I collaborate less with the team roles of a shaper and co-ordinator. I am not able to work properly
            under pressure and I find it a bit challenging for now. What is more, a shaper usually focuses on complicated challenges and 
            does his best to solve the problems and I am doing my best to be determined and be able also to solve such problems quickly.
            I am learning how to correctly set goals and distribute tasks among all team members. Also, I am gaining knowledge of how to 
            correctly make decisions so that they will have a positive outcome in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Question 9: Which team roles are represented in your team? Use the first and second preferred role of 
            each group member for your answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 7 people in my team and each member has his own team roles based on his or her skills and knowledge. I am a team 
            worker and plant, also we have a co-ordinator, and resource investigator who is basically our secretary, implementer, shaper, 
            monitor evaluator, specialist, and complete finisher. In my opinion, all team members have one specific team role according 
            to their skills and they can easily cope with their responsibilities. However, when any of our team members have some 
            obstacles we try to help each other and it means that we can have the second role to use necessary skills and solve 
            the problem. Now I think we have quite a big variety of different team roles and it is easier for us to work together 
            because our different backgrounds and experiences give us the opportunity to gather all these things together and achieve 
            success. I believe during our project some team members will find some other suitable roles for themselves and it will 
            make our team even more powerful.
        </p>
        <p>Question 10: How are the roles distributed? Which role is over-represented? What is missing?</p>
        <p><i>Write down your chosen option(s) as well.</i></p>

        </div>
            <p>
                To my mind, all these team roles are necessary because they make teamwork a bit easier and clearly 
                explain their characteristics and responsibilities. I believe it would be a good idea to add some 
                more roles to make teamwork even more interesting and diverse. For example, a strategist planner 
                could be a person who plans everything not only for a short period like an implementer but also sets 
                long-term tasks so that all plans would be made in advance and the team would have a clear plan for 
                the future. In addition, it would be interesting to add the position of a "customer", this role would
                focus on understanding and representing the needs and perspectives of the customer, ensuring that the
                team’s outputs meet up with customer expectations. Moreover, it is probably a good idea to have a "manager" 
                capture the abilities of team members and then analyze them to use their skills even more effectively.

                        <td>Personally, I believe all team roles are connected with each other and complement other team roles. The co-ordinator can help turn the plant's unique ideas into actionable plans, while the plant’s creativity can provide the co-ordinator with fresh perspectives and solutions. What is more, the shaper focuses on results and motivates the implementer, who in turn provides the structured plan of actions and discipline needed to execute the shaper’s ideas. The specialist can provide technical work and bring the plant’s ideas into real tasks, while the plant’s creativity can push the specialist to find new directions for turning ideas into actions.</td>

The resource investigator's duty is to chase new opportunities and start new tasks that might conflict with the completer finisher as he needs to ensure that existing tasks are completed properly and on time.</td>

I can also try to set tasks and make sure that they are done on time. In addition, I can do research and find rare information which can come in handy while working on a project. Also, support team members and provide help when it is needed.</td>
