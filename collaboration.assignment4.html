    <p>24. Open question</p>
    <p>Reflection question: to what extent do you agree that the common goals in a collaboration should take precedence over individual goals?</p>
    <p>Your answer</p>
    <p>
        In my opinion, the team’s common goals in most cases take priority and are more important in a collaboration than individual ones.
        When a team works toward a shared purpose, aligning everyone’s efforts creates stronger results and helps avoid confusion or conflict. 
        Common goals provide direction, keep the group focused, and ensure that everyone contributes to the overall success of the project.
        However, individual goals also matter and should be set and achieved. When team members can pursue personal growth by learning more deeply, 
        specifically what they find interesting for themselves, and gaining more experience, they tend to be more motivated and committed. The best collaborations find a balance, prioritizing shared goals while also supporting individual development where possible.
        In short, common goals should lead, but individual goals should not be ignored. They can coexist and even strengthen one another.
