        <h1>Feedback</h1>
        <p>Learning outcome</p>
        <p>
            You are able to indicate the importance of feedback for learning and good 
            collaboration and are able to give and receive feedback in accordance 
            with the established (theoretical) rules.
        </p>
        <p>Question 1: Describe the situation.</p>
        <p> 
            I have noticed that sometimes you behave impatiently and interrupt when any of
            our team members are saying something as you don't give them the opportunity 
            to finish their sentence. I know that you are hard-working and I understand 
            that you want to share your ideas and thoughts immediately but it cuts the 
            conversation and disregards the current speaker and even sometimes he/she might 
            feel annoyed. Also, it seems that you sometimes miss what we are saying and it makes
            it difficult to communicate effectively because I or other team members try to help 
            you but you don't take into consideration our words and efforts. I would like you to 
            be more polite and appreciate other team members because sometimes we can have conflicts 
            and if we don't listen to each other, working in a group will be impossible. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Question 2:
            Now describe the feedback using the theory discussed<br>
            1. Conditions for good feedback<br>
            2. I-message<br>
            3. BECD method

                <li>What was it like to give the other person feedback?</li>
                <li>To what extent have you succeeded in conveying the core of the feedback to the other?</li>

            Personally, I believe giving feedback, especially when it is a tip feedback, 
            can feel challenging because you need to feel a balance between addressing the issues 
            and being respectful and supportive. However, using the BECD method made it a bit easier 
            to give feedback, and following the structure helps to make the feedback specific and clear 
            and not to miss any important points. It helped break down the situation into manageable parts: 
            identifying specific behaviors, explaining the impact, suggesting changes, and outlining desired outcomes. 
            This approach makes the feedback easier to understand and allows the recipient to see both the problems 
            and potential solutions. I am sure that it is important to know how to give feedback as the key to success 
            while working in a group is communication. What is more, it is very useful experience because you can improve 
            your communication skills and make working in a group more efficient as if team members receive and follow the 
            feedback working together will become easier and more effective as they will also develop their skills and gain 
            new knowledge. I really learnt a lot from this section and got lots of useful advice on how to give feedback
            properly and make it effective. Also, how to receive it and how it is important to listen to it and accept 
            it. In my opinion, now I am better at giving feedback as I am really trying to help other team members and 
            encourage them to become professionals by developing their skills. We already had the class where we gave 
            feedback to each other and I enjoyed it as we are all interested in the results of our project and we are 
            ready to change and develop our skills and do our best. I hope that the feedback which I shared with my 
            team members was useful for them and they will listen to my advice and maybe soon I will see their results 
            and improvements.

                <p>Receiving feedback</p>
                <p>Question 5:</p>
                <li>Describe as clearly as possible what feedback you have received.</li>
                <li>What was it like hearing this feedback?</li>

        <p>
            I have already received feedback from my teammate and he advised me to communicate more with 
            other team members in order to strengthen our relationships with the whole team. We have been 
            working together for 6 weeks in one group and I agree that with some team members, I communicate 
            more than with others. Now I am trying to talk with everyone equally and I can see that it is 
            becoming easier to work in a group because we know each other better and we feel more comfortable 
            sharing our opinions and thoughts. I took the feedback into account and I am already trying to be 
            more open to team members and talk with them more not only on topics related to the project but also 
            on some other free topics. I really enjoyed this feedback and I really want to get it from my team 
            members in the future too because feedbacks help me to become better and work on myself. I think it 
            is important to hear the feedback from people around me as it helps to understand better what I have 
            to work on more.
