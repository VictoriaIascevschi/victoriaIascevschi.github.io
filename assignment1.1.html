        <h1>The Importance of Collaboration</h1>
        <p>Question 1: What exactly is collaboration? What different aspects are involved?</p>
        <p>
            Collaboration is a process when different people with completely different backgrounds gather 
            together to achieve a certain goal/goals. During collaboration, people can share knowledge, 
            ideas and skills in order to get the desired result. Also, it includes flexibility as members 
            of a group must be open to new ideas, be able to adjust to new strategies and be ready for unexpected 
            changes in plans. Making decisions together and including everyone's viewpoint and opinion is significant. 
            Giving and receiving constructive feedback helps to improve the process and the final outcome. Defining 
            roles and responsibilities helps in doing work properly and quickly. Of course, the key to successful 
            collaboration is communication when all team members organize meetings to distribute responsibilities 
            fairly among the participants, solve problems that they encounter on their way while working on a project, 
            receive and give feedback, ask for help if it is needed, build trust and engage people in the mission so 
            that the work will be done on the high level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Question 2:
            What is the importance of collaboration when it comes to your (future) work?
            Is collaboration reflected in the competences and/or professional profile of your study programme?
            Support your answers with examples.
         </p>
         <p>
            Collaboration allows team members with different specializations to gather their knowledge 
            and skills together in order to perform more complicated tasks. Usually working in a group 
            helps to complete tasks efficiently. Collaboration helps in developing a range of different 
            skills, including communication, conflict solving and teamwork. These skills are highly valued 
            in any profession, especially in IT. Collaborative environments foster innovation by combining 
            diverse ideas and viewpoints. While teams brainstorm and refine ideas together, it leads to more 
            innovative and successful projects. The ability to collaborate effectively allows teams to adapt to 
            new challenges and set priorities. Collaboration is reflected in my IT study program and future work. 
            Group projects with team-time assignments involve solving complex problems, doing projects, and using 
            tools and techniques relevant to the IT industry. Now my team is working on the project and we all are 
            doing our best to succeed. Later, during my internship, I will work for a real company and I will need 
            to collaborate with experienced developers and project managers.
         </p>
         <p>
            Question 3: On the basis of the above exercise, make an initial estimate of which aspects of the collaboration
            competence you already excel at, what you have yet to develop and what has priority.
